    <h3>Is Time Reversible? The Mystery of Quantum State Collapse (December 22nd, 2025) </h3>
    <p><em>YouTube Video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DrTahaSelim" target="_blank">Taha Selim's Open Lab Channel</a></em></p>
    <p> Language: English </p>

    </div>
    <p>

We covered the mystery of quantum state collapse and the role of time reversibility in quantum mechanics. Why do some of the greatest minds in physics, like Schrödinger and Roger Penrose, claim quantum mechanics might be incomplete? The answer lies in the strange relationship between measurement and the nature of time.

In this video, we dive deep into the "Quantum Realm" to explore why equations like the Schrödinger equation are perfectly reversible in time, yet the act of measurement creates a "one-way street" that we cannot undo.

In This Video, We Explore:
<br />
<ul>
    <li>The Nature of Time: From Newton’s "fixed river" to Einstein’s relative spacetime, and why time remains an external parameter in classical physics.</li>
    <li>The Quantum Bubble: What happens when a qubit exists in superposition, being 0 and 1 simultaneously.</li>
    <li>The Measurement Paradox: Why quantum systems are reversible before we look at them, but collapse into a single state once measured.</li>
    <li>Quantum Gravity &amp; Pixelated Time: Can combining relativity and quantum mechanics prove that space and time are not continuous, but "pixelated"?</li>
    <li>Consciousness vs. Physics: Does the human mind influence the outcome of quantum experiments, or is the "statistical behavior" a fundamental property of nature itself?</li>
</ul>

    <p>
This video marks the conclusion of the 10th edition of the quantum AI monthly series, reflecting on the "Year of Quantum," 2025. The event brought together global experts to discuss the integration of quantum processing units (QPUs) with classical supercomputing, energy efficiency, and the shift toward "native" quantum algorithms.
<br /><br />
This summary captures the key activities, technical presentations, and roundtable insights from the 10th edition of the Quantum AI monthly series, reflecting on the "Year of Quantum," 2025.
<br /><br />
Overview of Activities:
Presented by Engineer Youssef Eldakar (Bibliotheca Alexandrina), the series is a collaboration with iQafé to build a regional quantum ecosystem.
Quantum AI Lab: Offers 13 labs in quantum simulation and machine learning.
C-Forum: A new initiative (c-forum.batics.org) linking HPC with quantum research.
Hardware Carnival: A co-organized event with IEEE Egypt scheduled for Dec 25th.
<br /><br />
Roundtable: Future of Quantum Utility
The panel (Moderator Dr. Taha Selim, Ahmed Sleem, Alain Chancé, Dr. Damir Cavar, and Shwetha) reached a consensus on the following:
Native vs. Mapped Logic: Dr. Selim and Dr. Cavar warned that "mapping" classical logic (like neural networks) to quantum hardware is inefficient. The future lies in native quantum algorithms that leverage linearity and unitary nature.
Defining Universality: A "universal" quantum computer should be defined as a machine capable of running any physics-compliant quantum algorithm within a hybrid ecosystem, not a machine that solves every classical problem. In particular Dr. Selim and Sleem defined what a general purpose quantum computer means. 
Modular Architecture: Ahmed Sleem (IBM) highlighted the shift to modular System Two designs using "C," "M," and "L" couplers to create scalable, heterogeneous environments.
<br /><br />
Energy Metrics: The true metric for quantum is time-to-solution. A QPU solving in minutes what a supercomputer takes years to solve is inherently more efficient.
The Human/AI Gap: Alain Chancé noted that humans struggle to visualize high-dimensional quantum spaces; AI may eventually "understand" these states better than we can.
<br /><br />
The Submarine Analogy: Treating a quantum computer like a faster classical computer is like trying to drive a submarine on a highway. They are both vehicles, but the submarine is built for a different environment (quantum physics). The future is a hybrid network: take the car (CPU) to the dock, and the submarine (QPU) for the deep dive.

    <p>

In this episode of Ask Quantum Industry, the team reviews key takeaways from the recent IBM Quantum Summit in the Netherlands. We dive deep into IBM’s updated hardware roadmap, the evolution of the Qiskit SDK, and the critical role of hybrid computing in the near future.
<br /><br />
The discussion explores the tension between rapid software updates and developer stability, the distinction between quantum utility and advantage, and the strategies needed to build thriving quantum ecosystems and startups in emerging markets.
<br /><br />
<strong>Key Topics Discussed</strong>:
<br />
**IBM Quantum Summit Overview**: A look at IBM's global initiatives to expand quantum technology awareness and their aggressive roadmap targeting quantum advantage by 2026 and fault tolerance by 2029.
<br /><br />

The State of Qiskit: Analysis of IBM’s widely used SDK, the challenges of backward compatibility, and the necessity of evolving code to match new chip architectures.

Quantum Utility vs. Advantage: Understanding the nuances between efficiency (advantage) and native capability (utility), with real-world use cases from HSBC, Boeing, and Mercedes.

The Hybrid Future: Why the path forward isn't just quantum, but a seamless integration of quantum processors with classical HPC and AI infrastructure.

Startups &amp; Ecosystems: A candid look at the challenges facing quantum startups, particularly in Africa and Egypt, focusing on the need for funding, incubation, and stronger academic-industry bridges.

<strong>Summary Highlights: </strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Global Initiatives &amp; Roadmap:</strong> Ahmed Sleem and Taha discuss the significance of the Amsterdam summit in uniting the European and Middle Eastern quantum communities. The group analyzes IBM’s milestones since 2016 and the technological breakthroughs required to meet the 2029 fault-tolerance goal.</li>
    <li><strong>Software Challenges:</strong> Greg raises important concerns regarding the effort required to maintain code amidst frequent Qiskit updates. The panel discusses the balance between foundational development and community-led innovation, noting the shift toward more tight integration with hardware.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-World Applications:</strong> The team reviews how noisy quantum systems are already providing value. Highlights include a 37% improvement in bond trade portfolio prediction with HSBC and material discovery projects with Boeing.</li>
    <li><strong>Educational &amp; Startup Strategy:</strong> The conversation concludes with a focus on the future workforce. From IBM’s FallFests to university hackathons, the group emphasizes that successful quantum startups require a foundation of market-aware research and robust support systems.</li>

    <h3> Why Quantum Mechanics Feels Incomplete: Measurement, Time Reversibility, &amp; Quantum Gravity  (December 6th, 2025) </h3>

Why Quantum Mechanics Feels Incomplete: Quantum Measurement, Quantum Gravity, andTime Algorithm, and Quantization of Time, 
<br /><br />
If a comet wiped out all life on Earth tomorrow, would time continue to tick? Or does time require a human observer to exist?
<br /><br />
In this episode, we explore the elusive nature of time—from Isaac Newton’s "fixed river" to Einstein’s relative spacetime. But the real mystery arises when we zoom into the quantum world. Why do some physicists claim quantum mechanics is "incomplete" or "inconsistent" when it comes to time? 
<br /><br />
We dive deep into the behavior of Qubits, Superposition, and the Collapse of the Wave Function to understand why time seems to be reversible in Schrödinger's equation but becomes strictly irreversible the moment we measure it. Would this form a flaw in quantum mechanics, or is it simply a limit of our current knowledge? Does the universe have a pixelated "resolution"? Is time an algorithm running in the background? Let’s find out.
<br /><br />
In this video, we cover:
<ul>
    <li>The Thought Experiment: What happens to time in an empty universe?</li>
    <li>Classical vs. Relativistic Time: How gravity and speed change the flow of time.</li>
    <li>The Quantum Qubit: Understanding superposition and the "quantum bubble".</li>
    <li>The Collapse: Why measurement breaks the symmetry of time.</li>
    <li>The Controversy: Why Einstein, Schrödinger, and Penrose complained about this apparent inconsistency.</li>
    <li>Quantum Gravity: Is space-time continuous or made of discrete "grains"?</li>
</ul>
